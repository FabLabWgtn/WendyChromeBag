# WendyChromeBag
A digitally- and hand-crafted bag that fits a chromebook with a few other things
You can choose whatever materials you like, but I used cork fabric from Portugal and 3mm wool felt from New Zealand. Because the material is so thick, I lasered all the sewing holes and then hand sewed them. 
The shoulder strap is made from two leather belts from the second-hand shop.
